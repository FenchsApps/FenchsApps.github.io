# **App Name**: FenchsApps Portfolio

## Core Features:

- Welcome Section: Display a large 'Welcome' text followed by 'FenchsApps' at the top of the page.
- GitHub API Integration: Fetch user's repositories from the GitHub API (https://github.com/FenchsApps/) using their username and organize them by programming language.
- Repository Categorization: Categorize and display repositories under their respective programming languages (e.g., Python, C++, JavaScript).
- GitHub Button: Include a button that links directly to the user's GitHub profile.
- Background Effect: Implement the provided DarkVeil background effect using OGL.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Animated texture effect as defined by the provided DarkVeil component and code. This will result in an organic dark background of shifting dark hues, with moving contours. (DarkVeil uses its own internal color scheme.)
- Text color: White with a slight purple gradient overlay (#FFFFFF with purple overlay).  The white provides necessary contrast against the organic, dynamic background.
- Font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for both headings and body text. Inter is clean and modern, and will ensure legibility over the animated background.
- Main layout: A single-page layout with the welcome section at the top, followed by repository categories, and the GitHub button at the bottom. The DarkVeil texture fills the background. 
- Background Animation: The DarkVeil background effect will provide subtle, continuous animation.
